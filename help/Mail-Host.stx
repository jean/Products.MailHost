Mail Host
  
  Mail Hosts allow you to send mail via SMTP.
  
  **Note:** Please be aware that this object uses relaying
  to send the E-Mail message. Most E-Mail servers do not allow
  relaying other from themselves. So, if you have a Mail 
  server setup by default on your box (like for Red Hat 
  installs), you should be able to use your localhost as mail
  server.
